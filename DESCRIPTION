Description: Tests regarding the structure of a covariance or a correlation matrices. 
 Hereby an investigated structure is chosen, while most of the common used are possible, like auto-regressive, compound-symmetry or diagonal. Then Monte-Carlo, Bootstrap and Taylor based Monte-Carlo-techniques are used, and the respective method must be chosen, 
 and the functions provide p-values and mostly also estimators of calculated covariance matrices of test statistics.
